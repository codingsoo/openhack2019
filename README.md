## 2019 OpenHack

This is a project scoring tool that will be a reference for judges at the 2019 OpenHack (Opensource Hackathon). This tool will evaluate how many people are engaged in the project, how many commit is added, and so on. This project's codes are based on [Hackathoners](https://github.com/harrydrippin/hackathoners).
